# E-voting System

This project is a simple C++ program that simulates an electronic voting system. It allows users to vote for candidates, display voting results, and exit the program. This project was developed as a part of the programming fundamentals course in the first semester.

## Features

- *Add Candidates*: Input names and places for candidates participating in the election.
- *Vote for Candidates*: Users can cast their votes for the listed candidates.
- *Display Voting Results*: View the current tally of votes for each candidate.
- *Exit the Program*: Safely exit the application after voting.

## Functionalities

1. *Candidate Registration*: Users can register candidates by entering their names and associated places. The system is designed to handle a limited number of candidates.

2. *Voting Process*: Each user can cast a vote for a candidate. The voting process is restricted to a predefined number of voters.

3. *Results Display*: The system can display the voting results at any time, showing the number of votes each candidate has received.

4. *Exit Option*: Users can exit the program after they have completed the voting process or checked the results.

## Limitations

- The number of candidates and voters is limited to a predefined number.
- The system does not handle duplicate votes by the same voter.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

## Usage

1. *Compile the Code*: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.
2. *Run the Program*: Execute the compiled binary to start the voting system.
3. *Follow On-Screen Instructions*: The program will guide you through the steps of adding candidates, voting, displaying results, and exiting.
